Title: Java-Based Exam Seating Arrangement Management System 
Abstract 
This Java-based application provides a simple yet efficient exam seating arrangement 
management system that enables administrators and students to handle seating 
assignments in a convenient manner. The program utilizes JDBC to connect with a 
MySQL database and perform various operations related to student seating 
arrangements. 
The application begins by prompting the user to select their role: "admin" or 
"student." Based on the input, the user is presented with specific options: 
1. For Administrators: 
 Option 1: Retrieve student details - This option fetches student data 
from the "Exam Seating Arrangement" table in the "Student details" 
MySQL database. The data includes student roll numbers, names, and 
other relevant information. 
 Option 2: Arrange students based on given data - This feature allows 
administrators to create a new table named "class_bench2" and 
populate it with seating arrangements for exams. Administrators input 
the number of classes and the number of benches for each class, and 
the system automatically generates and assigns seating arrangements. 
2. For Students: 
 Option 0: Fetch Seating Details - Students can enter their roll numbers 
to access their assigned seating information. The application retrieves 
the class number and bench number for the specific student from the 
"class_bench2" table. 
The program efficiently manages seating assignments, making it easier for 
administrators to organize exams effectively and for students to find their designated 
seats without confusion 
 
The key features of this exam seating arrangement management system project 
include: 
1. Role-Based Access: The system supports two roles - "admin" and "student." 
Users are required to select their role, and the system provides relevant 
options based on the chosen role. 
2. Student Details Retrieval: Administrators can easily retrieve student details, 
including roll numbers, names, and other relevant information from the "Exam 
Seating Arrangement" table in the "Student details" database. 
3. Dynamic Seating Arrangement: Administrators can efficiently arrange students 
for exams by specifying the number of classes and benches required. The 
system automatically generates and inserts seating arrangements into the 
"class_bench2" table, ensuring an organized and fair distribution of students. 
4. Student Seating Information: Students can fetch their assigned seating details 
by entering their roll numbers. The system retrieves the class number and 
bench number from the "class_bench2" table, allowing students to find their 
designated seats effortlessly. 
5. Secure Database Connectivity: The project utilizes Java Database Connectivity 
(JDBC) to establish a secure connection with the MySQL database. This 
ensures that sensitive student information and seating arrangements are 
stored and accessed safely. 
6. Efficient Database Operations: The program efficiently executes SQL queries to 
manage data, including student details and seating arrangements, within the 
MySQL database. 
7. User-Friendly Interface: The system prompts users with clear instructions and 
options, making it easy for both administrators and students to interact with 
the application. 
8. Error Handling: The project incorporates error handling mechanisms to handle 
potential exceptions and database connectivity issues, providing a smooth 
user experience. 
9. Scalability: The application can accommodate an increasing number of 
students and classes, allowing it to be used in various educational institutions. 
10. Database Management: The system allows administrators to drop existing 
tables and create new ones as needed, ensuring flexibility and adaptability for 
future requirements. 
Overall, this exam seating arrangement management system streamlines the process 
of arranging and accessing student seating information for exams. It provides a user
friendly interface and efficient database operations, making it a valuable tool for 
educational institutions and exam administrators.
